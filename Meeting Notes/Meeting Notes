Meeting 1: 9/22/21

First Deadline: Monday, 9/27/21
- EDA Finished
- 2 Visuals


Meeting 2
Review Code, Continue Pre-processing

Meeting 3: 10/6/21
- Train, Valid, Test Split Data before Data Pre-Processing
- Reviewed Each of Our Codes
- Idea: Combine Month and Day and then split dates into quarters? 

- Balance
	- Normalize Numeric Values 
	- Normalized in a plot - crosstabdestnorm
	
- Dummy Variables - 2 can deduce 

Moving Forward: 
- Decide on Dummy Variables
- Converting Binary Values
- Resample of data to balance data? 
- Normalize Numeric Values
- Do we need to resample to balance the data? Leaning towards no as a group consensus but will play by ear

**PLAN FOR PROJECT**
Import Data
Transform Data (yes = 1 and dummy variables)
	All yes/no turns into binary values
	Dummy Variables: job, marital
	Binning System: Job
	Change Education to Ordinal to [0, .25, .5, 1]
	
Data Cleaning
Train, Valid, Test Split - Set Random State
Initial Modeling

Separate Dataframe differences
- no binning for job
- remove outliers

Train, Valid, Test Split 
- Train .4
- rest_data and test_size remaining (reference HW 2)
- set random_state as same reference to HW 2


Saturday 10:30 AM
 - Meet to go over the all the information and have a model done
 - Finalize Model by Monday Evening
 - Module 6 Week - Executive Summary Powerpoint, fill in all the text for report, and video presentation.
